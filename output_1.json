Let the red wine come to a boil, and boil it for three minutes. Add the water and reduce the heat to bring everything to a quick simmer.   Boiling the wine for three minutes will lower the alcohol content a bit, leaving the deep flavor of the wine behind. With the addition of the water, the shanks and vegetables should be fully submerged in liquid. If they aren't, add a little more water."
